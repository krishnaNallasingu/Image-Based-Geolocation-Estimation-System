# üõ∞Ô∏è Image-Based Geolocation Prediction on IIIT-H Campus
*IIIT Hyderabad | Spring 2025*

---
## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to predict info from images taken across the IIIT Hyderabad campus. Using annotated data with spatial and temporal metadata, a CNN-based model was developed to learn visual and spatial patterns for accurate geolocation and orientation estimation on unseen images.
- **Latitude** (scaled)
- **Longitude** (scaled)
- **Camera Angle**
- **Region ID** (categorical: 1‚Äì15)

The objective is to develop a robust deep learning model capable of both regression and classification based on visual input alone.

## üß† Task Description

- **Data Collection**:
  - Captured and annotated over 3,000 images across 15 predefined regions on campus.
  - Each image is tagged with metadata: GPS coordinates, timestamp, orientation angle, and region ID.

- **Dataset Features**:
  - `Image`
  - `Latitude` *(scaled)*
  - `Longitude` *(scaled)*
  - `Angle`
  - `Region ID` (1‚Äì15)

- **Modeling Approach**:
  - Designed a **CNN-based architecture** for:
    - **Regression**: Latitude, Longitude, Angle
    - **Classification**: Region ID
  - Compared performance of multi-output joint models vs. task-specific models.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) for latitude, longitude, and angle.
  - Accuracy (up to 6 decimal places) for region classification.
